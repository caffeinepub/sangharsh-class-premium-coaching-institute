  "summary": "Implemented static sitemap.xml and robots.txt in frontend/public, plus added hosting config files (_headers, _redirects) and updated 404.html logic to avoid SPA fallback for /sitemap.xml and /robots.txt. Deployment checklist changes shown do not include the requested explicit sitemap validation section.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Add/update deployment verification documentation to include explicit sitemap checks: verifying dist/sitemap.xml exists, requesting /sitemap.xml returns HTTP 200 with Content-Type: application/xml, and confirming the URL is not being served by SPA fallback HTML.",
      "reason": "The provided DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md excerpt includes build, SPA fallback, and other production checks, but does not show a dedicated section/checklist items for /sitemap.xml status/body/content-type verification.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md (truncated excerpt shows no sitemap-specific checks)"
