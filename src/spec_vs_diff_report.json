  "summary": "Implemented favicon link tags, JSON-LD structured data, SPA fallback exclusions, and ICP asset header/cache rules for favicon requests. However, the diff does not show the actual favicon image/icon files being added to frontend/public, and several unrelated UI/SEO/verification and app-behavior changes were made beyond the favicon-only scope. Production redeploy/verification cannot be confirmed from code changes alone.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add favicon assets derived from the existing Sangharsh Classes logo and publish them at the site root via frontend/public/favicon.png and frontend/public/favicon.ico (or document shipping only PNG).",
      "reason": "The diff shows references and hosting rules for favicon.png/favicon.ico, but does not show the favicon files themselves being added under frontend/public/. No added files are listed, and no file content for favicon assets is shown.",

      "requirement": "Redeploy the site and verify in production that favicon URLs return 200 with correct image/icon content and are not rewritten/cached incorrectly.",
      "reason": "Redeploying and production verification are operational steps; no evidence of a production check (HTTP 200/image content validation) can be confirmed from the diff summary.",
