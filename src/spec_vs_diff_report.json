  "summary": "Diff adds a dedicated React AboutPage routed at /about, removes About from the homepage, sets About page title/meta description via useEffect, updates sitemap to include /about, and updates the static export build to write an about/index.html via generateAboutPageHTML. However, the diff does not provide evidence that the About body content is the exact user-provided text verbatim, and the static-export About HTML generator implementation (generateAboutPageHTML) is not shown/confirmed in the provided diff summary.",

      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Place the user-provided About page body content on the About page exactly as provided (verbatim, character-for-character, including punctuation and line breaks), and only on the About page.",
      "reason": "AboutPage renders content from marketingSiteContent.about.seoDescription and marketingSiteContent.about.paragraphs arrays rather than showing the exact user-provided About text in the diff. The actual verbatim body text is not visible/confirmed in the diff summary, so it cannot be verified as character-for-character identical.",

      "reason": "vite.config.ts now writes dist/static-export/about/index.html using generateAboutPageHTML(), but the implementation/output of generateAboutPageHTML is not shown in the diff summary (renderStaticSite.ts snippet only shows generateStaticHTML). Therefore it cannot be confirmed that the generated About HTML includes the exact H1/title/meta description and verbatim body content.",
